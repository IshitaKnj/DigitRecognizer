# DigitRecognizer
This is a model to recognize the handwritten digits.
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.It is a hard task for the machine because
handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors.
The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
Developing such a system includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0â€“9).
